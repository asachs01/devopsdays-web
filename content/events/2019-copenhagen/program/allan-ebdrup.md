I have given many talks about DevOps, but I realised, that I had always had the most focus on the Dev in DevOps. In this talk I'll try to the best of my ability to remedy that, and talk about the more Ops'y things we've had practical experiences with in a DevOps setting. For example: Have you considered that there might be inherent security risks looming if you implement a microservices architecture? And that good DevOps is needed to remedy this?
