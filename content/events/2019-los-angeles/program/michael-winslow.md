Listen closely. Close your eyes. I know you hear it coming. It's the microservices buzz. Well, by now it is more of a quake.

I've been on 2 enterprise level microservices implementations. One was greenfield and the other was a migration from a FAT service. It turns out that the 2 easiest things to do when moving to microservices are to DECIDE to do it and to WRITE THE CODE. If you stick around after that, you better be ready for a ride!

I'd like to share my team's story with anyone who is thinking about going down this path or who has experienced it themselves.
