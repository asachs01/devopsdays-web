The change in developer operations is a constant evolution. Even when a process or pipelines feel perfect something new can come along and make it better. My talk will focus on a personal tale of developer operations that I have implemented over the last 15+ years of my career and go in depth of what worked and what did not over my last 15+ years in development.Â
