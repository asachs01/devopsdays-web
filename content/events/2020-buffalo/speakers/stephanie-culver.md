Stephanie has been engineering large scale platforms for the past 10 years, focusing on reducing maintenance through DevOps practices and adoption of configuration as code to meet strategic business objectives. She loves to learn, and has used curiosity to allow her to move her work between enabling development on Microsoft platforms in internal clouds, to Linux-based container platforms on the public cloud, and Target’s edge compute team configuring servers and virtualization at every Target store. As a team leader, her relentless customer focus has enabled her to create and deliver superior products. She’s passionate about engineering excellence and empowering technologists by sharing knowledge and opportunities. Her insistence the entire team use good development practices limited the impact of an accidental production-wide patching event.

Stephanie holds a Masters degree in Information Management Systems from Harvard University and a BS in Management Information Systems from Northeastern University. She spends her time outside of work heavily involved in the sport of figure skating, where she been honing teamwork skills for over twenty years as a competitive synchronized figure skater with multiple US national championship titles.
