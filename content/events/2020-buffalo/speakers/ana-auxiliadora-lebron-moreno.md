I have been working in the technology industry for the last 10 years in different roles. I started my career as a system engineer in the aerospace industry working in Germany and Spain. In 2010 I undertook an MBA, specializing in Technology Operations and since then I have worked at Enova International (Fintech company in Chicago) as project manager. My role is leading Release Engineering, Incident Response and Site Reliability Engineering teams.

I am a DevOps and Agile advocate, but my real passion is to spend time with my family (hiking, walking to a coffee shop or just going to the park with my daughters). I keep Spain and its culture very close to my heart, so I travel there every time I can. While I am in Chicago, I love playing volleyball and summer is the best time for me to set up a court at the beach and spend the day playing. I also enjoy dancing and (like a good Spaniard) flamenco is my favorite. Oh! And I recently started kick-boxing (so do not mess with me :)).
